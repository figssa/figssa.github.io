## What are lightning talks?

Lightning talks are short (3 minutes maximum, strictly enforced) talks. They can be accompanied by visual media (powerpoint, etc.) or delivered orally only. Immediately following one talk, the next talk begins (ie, there are no questions or comments).

## How are lightning talks going to be employed at the GHEF?

As per the <a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/schedule">schedule</a>, there will be a round of lightning talks on the morning of Thursday, September 29th, 2016. For these talks, the content should describe one current or recently finished research project. 

## Why lightning talks?

Lightning talks have the advantage of allowing many people to share in a short amount of time. Questions and comments are avoided so that many people can share. The expectation is that lightning talks allow participants to identify others who work in similar areas, so that they can sync up informally later.

## Does everyone have to participate?

Nobody has to do anything. But we do encourage all participants, even those not presenting a poster, to give a lightning talk on their own research.
